# A Few Visualization Projects

In this repository, you can find a few projects I did in the Fall of 2022 to practice data visualization. 

1) The final project contains 4 graphics that walk through the changes in professional playstyle for a character in my favorite video game. There is a heatmap grid, 2 scatter plots, and a ridgeline plot.

2) hw4 has a map created for a problem in one of my homeworks. The map shows Chicago school districts, public high schools, and their respective changes in graduation rates over the pandemic. Each district is also shaded by the percentage of student eligible for free and reduced lunch.

3) Lastly, the motherhood file has a horizontal bar chart comparing when American mothers of different races began prenatal care in 1985. It paints a picture of healthcare access in America at the time, as well as provides a snapshot of which races the US federal government found important to differentiate and trace.
